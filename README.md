# Payworks task
Payworks task: *​Credit​ ​Card​ ​Number​ ​Evaluator*

This task melded well with my experience of card management in the POS industry.

In this code I have attempted to demonstrate my proficiency in the following areas.

#### Credit card management

My many years of experience dealing with credit cards has highlighted a number of important requirements for retailers.

1. The ability to add extra card ranges to the validation system to allow for special cards such as loyalty cards.
2. Validation of other range-based inputs such as voucher barcodes.

Although this is obviously only two day work I believe I have achieved most of the functionality required
